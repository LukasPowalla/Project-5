RK4 has precision of O(t^4) for x AND v (local error); whereas Verlet has (in general) a precision of O(t^4) for x and of  O(t^2) for v. Therefore, RK4 has in theory the better precision. But RK4 is more sensitive to changing the time steps. That means: Verlet is always stable, RK4 depends on the step length, but can get better precision if it is stable. But as Verlet is cheaper concerning number of FLOP, we will use this for the n-particle system with high n.
